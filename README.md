# game_map

Game Map is a small game developed purely using Python 3.8 and being displayed in the shell of any operative System.

The game consist about one or multiple players that needs to find the exit square throwing many dices as possible. In the board map they will find multiple types of square where they can fall inside:

## Squares
- Start: The first square where all the players starts the first iteration of the game.
- Monsters: If the character falls into one of these squares, they will fight with the monster during multiple iterations while both of them are alive. Some monster could give some weapons to wear.
- Portals: If a character falls inside into a portal, he/she will be teleported into another portal position. If the character has an specific weapon, then will can choose which portal exit to take.
- Exit: The first character to falls into will win the game.

## Future Implementations:
- Treasure: This will include a weapon to help the characters increasing their vital status or giving them any ability: cross fake walls of capacity of choose the exit of a teleport.
- PRINT MAP: The project needs a better way to make the prints of the map into the shell.

## Future Enhancements:
- Docker: Using Docker, create a container where the game is fully playable.
- Create a web application where the game would have a more visual and interactive display.
